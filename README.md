# FSND-Portfolio-Website
This is a repository for the "Build a Portfolio Site" project which is the second project required for completing the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.

The main purpose of this project is to let students understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS by building a website based off a design mockup.

I used the Bootstrap&trade; front-end framework (version 4.0.0-alpha.6) to make the website responsive (mobile-first) and the _Font Awesome&trade;_ toolkit (version 5.3.1) for adding social media icons.
